# android-system-package-clean

On some Android devices, you'll find packages from Facebook, Instagram, and others 'pre-installed' on your device and they cannot be uninstalled, only deactivated. This is common on Samsung devices.

They claim that these are simply 'stubs' or 'placeholders' for the actual apps and can't function until the actual app is installed from the Play Store but these stubs provide elevated privileges to these apps.

Personally, I don't dig these packages and want nothing to do with them on my device. You can use this simple bash script to remove them.

## Run Script

It's a bash script. Run main.bash, simple pimple.

## Requirements

1. Install ADB on your computer, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/">here's how</a>
2. Enable developer options on your phone, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/129728/how-to-access-the-developer-options-menu-and-enable-usb-debugging-on-android-4.2/#:~:text=To%20enable%20Developer%20Options%2C%20open,times%20to%20enable%20Developer%20Options.">here's how</a>

## Notice

I claim no responsibility for any consequences of running this script in perpetuity throughout the universe, good luck.
